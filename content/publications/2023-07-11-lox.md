This thesis describes and analyzes the Lox design and protocols and evaluates the load of the system relative to known usecases, such as the bridge user base."

Lox incorporates each of the features described in this section into a novel privacy-preserving scheme. Lox allows users to build trust over time. Upon reaching a predetermined trust level, users are able to invite a number of friends. When a user is invited by a trusted user, they join Lox at a lower trust level and inherit their inviter’s bridges and the number of blocking events they have witnessed. These features are encoded as attributes in a user’s Lox credential, which allows the user to remain anonymous through their interactions with the system.
