### Hello World.

I am a privacy and security researcher and software developer working on the
[anti-censorship team](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/team) at [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/).

My research focuses on privacy enhancing technologies and censorship circumvention systems.

I am a graduate of the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab (MMath 2022), where I worked under [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). 

My graduate work on [Lox](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18333), a privacy preserving, reputation based bridge distribution system to support censorship circumvention efforts, is currently being integrated into [Tor Browser](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/lox). 

A shorter version of my [full thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18333) was published in [PETS'23](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0029.php) and won the [Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award](https://petsymposium.org/student-paper-award.php). The original Lox library is [available here](https://git-crysp.uwaterloo.ca/iang/lox).

I previously worked with the [LEAP Encryption Access Project](https://leap.se/) on designing robust, UDP based pluggable transports for censorship circumvention. I wrote about some of the reasoning behind, and challenges involved in this effort in [LEAP's blog](https://leap.se/#blog). 

In the past I also worked with [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) on Kubernetes [Cluster Federation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed) and the [Tekton vscode plugin](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-tekton).
