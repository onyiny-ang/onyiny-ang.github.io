### Hello World.

I am a privacy and security researcher and software developer currently working on

My research focuses on privacy enhancing technologies and censorship circumvention systems.

I have previously worked with the [LEAP Encryption Access Project](https://leap.se/) on designing robust, UDP based pluggable transports for censorship circumvention.

I am a graduate of the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab (MMath 2022) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada where I worked under [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). 

My graduate work on [Lox](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18333), a privacy preserving bridge distribution system to support censorship circumvention efforts,
is currently being incorporated into [Tor Browser](https://gitlab.torproject.org/cohosh/lox-server). 

A shorter version of my full thesiswill be published in [PETS'23](https://petsymposium.org/2023/)) with the Lox library [available here](https://git-crysp.uwaterloo.ca/iang/lox).
