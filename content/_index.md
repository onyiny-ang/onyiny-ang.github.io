### Hello World.

I am a privacy and security researcher and software developer.

My research focuses on privacy enhancing technologies and censorship circumvention systems.

I previously worked with the [LEAP Encryption Access Project](https://leap.se/) on designing robust, UDP based pluggable transports for censorship circumvention. I wrote about some of the reasoning behind, and challenges involved in this effort in [LEAP's blog](https://leap.se/#blog). 


In the past I also worked with [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) on Kubernetes [Cluster Federation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed) and the [Tekton vscode plugin](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-tekton).

I am a graduate of the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab (MMath 2022) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada where I worked under [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). 

My graduate work on [Lox](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18333), a privacy preserving bridge distribution system to support censorship circumvention efforts, is currently being integrated into [Tor Browser](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/lox-rs). 

A shorter version of my full thesis will be published in [PETS'23](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0029.php) with the Lox library [available here](https://git-crysp.uwaterloo.ca/iang/lox).
