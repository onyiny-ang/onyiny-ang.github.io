description: "This is our implementation of Lox, a reputation-based bridge distribution system that
provides privacy protection to users and their social graph and is open to all
users. The Lox repo, written in Rust by my supervisor Ian Goldberg and me, includes test
suites that were used to produce the results in my MMath thesis and our PETS'23 paper. 
Lox is [currently being incorpoarted into Tor browser](https://gitlab.torproject.org/cohosh/lox-wasm) to be tested out as an alternative to [Tor's bridgedb](https://bridges.torproject.org/)."
