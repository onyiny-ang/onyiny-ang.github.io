Lox allows users to build trust over time. Upon reaching a predetermined trust level, users are able to invite a number of friends. When a user is invited by a trusted user, they join Lox at a lower trust level and inherit their inviter’s bridges and the number of blocking events they have witnessed. These features are encoded as attributes in a user’s Lox credential, which allows the user to remain anonymous through their interactions with the system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://onyiny-ang.github.io/publications/oustral/">&lt;p&gt;In many parts of the world, censors are continuously increasing their capacity to fingerprint, identify, and block censorship resistance tools&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; 
to maintain control over what can and can not be accessed over the Internet. In response, traffic replacement, which involves co-opting a steady &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
stream of uncensored overt traffic to serve as a perfect cover for censored covert content, has been developed in an effort to provide undetectable &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
access to the open Internet for those in censored regions. Despite the promise of this technique, creating a suitable stream of uncensored overt traffic &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that is high throughput, fingerprint and identification resistant, and does not overburden the user to generate, is an underexplored area that is critical &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to traffic replacement&#x27;s success. To address this, we propose OUStralopithecus (OUStral for short), a web-based Overt User Simulator (OUS) that browses the &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
web as a human would in order to avoid being detected by a censor. We implement OUStral as a Python library that can be added to an existing traffic-replacement &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
system. To evaluate OUStral we connect it to an existing traffic replacement system, Slitheen, that replaces media data such as images. Additionally, we&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
implement WebM video replacement for Slitheen to demonstrate the high throughput that OUStral is able to provide. We show that OUStral evades being detected &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
as a bot by state-of-the-art bot detection software while providing a high-throughput overt data channel for covert data replacement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
